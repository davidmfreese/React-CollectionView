## React-CollectionView
[React-CollectionView](https://github.com/davidmfreese/React-CollectionView) brings UICollectionView to the web.  The goal is to create a performant collection view that delegates the layout and cell(s) implementation to the user.  Currently a simple FlowLayout implementation has been implemented and can be seen in the /examples folder.
